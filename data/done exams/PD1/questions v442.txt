-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. A business has a proprietary Order Management System (OMS) that creates orders
from their website and fulfills the orders. When the order is created in the OMS, an
integration also creates an order record in Salesforce and relates it to the contact as
identified by the email on the order. As the order goes through different stages in the
OMS, the integration also updates it in Salesforce.
It is noticed that each update from the OMS creates a new order record in
Salesforce.

Salesforce?
Choose 2 answers.

Use the email on the contact record as an external ID.

Use the order number from the OMS as an external ID.
