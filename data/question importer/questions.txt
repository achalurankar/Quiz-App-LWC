Universal Containers has an existing automation where a custom record called Account Plan is created upon on Account being marked as Customer. Recently,a Workflow Rule was added so that whenever an Account is marked as a Customer, a 'Customer Since' data field is updated with today's data.

Now, since the addition of the Workflow Rule, two Account Plan records are created whenever the Account is marked as a Customer.

What might cause this to happen?
section-end
question-type=single

The Apex Trigger responsible for the record creation does not use a static variable to ensure it only fires once.
option-end
The Process Builder responsible for the record creation fires before and after the Workflow rule.
option-end
The Workflow Rule responsible for the record creation fires twice because the 'Customer Since' field update is marked as 'Re-evaluate Workflow Rules After Field Change.'
option-end
The Apex Trigger responsible for the record creation is not bulk safe and calls insert inside of a for loop
